# moodle-block_course_list_advanced
The normal block course list shows all courses and has no information about the role in the course.

The block moodle-block_course_list_advanced adds some more information about a course. I adds the information which of the following roles a user is enrolled into a course.

For performance and testing-reason this first version only shows the content if the block is added into a course AND the user is trainer.

At the end of the block a list of all courses is shown where the usere is enrolled as teacher.

# ToDo #
- choose better colors
- add some more languagestring to instead of hardcoded text
- optimize code for enrollmentcheck
- change from php to moodle-codestyle
- correct some spelling mistake
- block may be "expensive" in large moodleinstances with many users. instead of using a block it might be a good idea to implement the functionality as a part of the profile-page
